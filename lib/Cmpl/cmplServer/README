*********** CMPLServer ********

CMPLServer is an XML-RPC-based web service for distributed optimization.
It is reasonable to solve large models remotely on the CMPLServer that is installed on a high performance system.
pyCMPL provides a client API for CMPLServer. CMPL provides three XML-based file formats for the communication 
between a CMPLServer and its clients. (CmplInstance, CmplSolutions, CmplMessages, CmplInfo)
